We will be documenting our progress on whisperframe here.
i will post screenshots of sucessfull module
implementation regularly and updates on progress 
towards full working virtual machines running
in ram completely from code extracted from pictures
and compiled entirely in RAM withiut wver having the
code stored on the hard drive. completion percentage right
now is at 78%. should be working within a week!
if your interested in working with us or want to 
invest we are accepting submissions! please
email me at justen@zeroday3.com thank you!


update 05/6/2025
we now have a WhisperVM v1 Virtual Processor = Fully Operational
this is the first frame:
Executes conditional logic
	•	Supports jumps
	•	Prints output from memory
	•	Self-updates pixel registers
https://github.com/zeroday31337x/whisperframev1/commit/5dae5c4e2abf567aef864b89d68ff48226da2dce
goal: a fully functional operating system running
on a virtualmachine all in RAM from images! 
ETA: 5 days! 
changing how data and code is stored and ran!

whisperframev1 Not just a tool — it’s a new architecture
	•	The bridge between data storage, execution, 
and self-evolving state — all in visual form
